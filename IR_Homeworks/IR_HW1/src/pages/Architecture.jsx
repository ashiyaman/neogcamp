          The Taj Mahal is a remarkable blend of various architectural styles,
          including Mughal, Persian and Italian. It is made of white marble, which was brought from different parts of India and Central Asia.

          Taj Mahal’s architecture combines residential and funerary buildings
          to create not only an exquisite tomb for her beloved but also a
          ‘paradise’ where the soul can run amok.
