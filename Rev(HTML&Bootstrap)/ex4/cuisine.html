          <p class="card-text"> Bhel Puri and Sev Puri are iconic street foods in Mumbai, celebrated for their simplicity and amazing flavours. Bhel Puri consists of puffed rice mixed with an assortment of chopped vegetables, tamarind sauce, and a medley of chutneys. The combination creates a delightful blend of sweet, tangy, and spicy tastes, heightened by the crunch of sev. Sev Puri, on the other hand, features flat puris topped with diced potatoes, onions, and a mix of chutneys—tamarind, chilli, and garlic. The dish is then loaded with layers of sev.</p>
