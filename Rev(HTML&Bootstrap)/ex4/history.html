        <h3>Ancient Period</h3>
        <p>The Koli, an aboriginal tribe of fishermen, were the earliest known inhabitants of present-day Mumbai, though Paleolithic stone implements found at Kandivli, in Greater Mumbai, indicate that the area has been inhabited by humans for hundreds of thousands of years.</p>

        <h3>Colonial Era</h3>
        <p>In the history of Mumbai, the islands faced challenges such as the Maratha Invasion of Goa and Bombay, as well as Mughal invasions of Konkan in 1685, toward the end of the 17th century. During the mid-18th century, under the rule of the English East India Company, Mumbai emerged as a crucial port city, engaging in maritime trade with destinations like Mecca and Basra.</p>
